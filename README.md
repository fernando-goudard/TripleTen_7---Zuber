# TripleTen_7---Zuber

## Zuber EDA

The activity consists of analyzing data collected from Zuber, a new ride-sharing company being launched in Chicago. The task is to find patterns in the available information. The goal is to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.

Working with a database, I will analyze competitor data and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.


## Conclusion

Through analysis and statistical testing, some important facts were identified. A few taxi agencies make up the majority of trips. A few neighborhoods are the destination for most passengers. On rainy Saturdays, the average duration of trips from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport has a longer average travel time.
